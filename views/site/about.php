<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="dcap">I</span>n 2012 seven female professionals with different expertise and different capabilities came together and created BWF.  
All the founders wanted the most transparent system regarding raising and utilizing the funds,
 as this is the biggest hesitation in people’s mind when it comes to donate their hard earned money. 
 In BWF it is our top priority that every penny we are raising should be utilized in the most transparent way and should reach to the right person.<br/>
Now, we are taking our efforts to next level by creating a network among NGOs who are genuine and have a specific field in which they are working excellently.  This new platform will give us an opportunity to cover all the layers of our society from top to bottom and our reach to the needy will expand exponentially. We hope that by joining hands with many more people elike us we can get maximum results in minimum efforts.

 Volunteering for a cause is also participation in a humanitarian objective. 
 Unlike the commercial involvement, your passion and commitment to the cause are important- we at beyond wallets also provide this platform for anything that you are passionate about.

<h3>MISSION AND VISION</h3>
<p>
Our vision is to try to make India a nation free from poverty, hunger and any kind of vices. 
A nation where no citizen goes to bed empty stomach, a nation where every citizen has access to healthcare, 
every child is healthy, has access to food, healthcare and education, a nation where everyone has a job to do, 
a nation where women are treated equally and with respect.<br/>
<b>To become a bridge between the haves and the have not’s.</b>  <br/>
We will mobilize the resources from those who have them and would like to donate it to the welfare of the society 
to those who have a vision to do something for the society and are working at the grass root level but lack sufficient resources to carry out their work.
